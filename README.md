# Datepicker
This is an example datepicker that allows you to reserve date ranges and disables them so others cannot. It is built with AngularJS and Firebase.

See it in action <a href="https://datepickerdemo.firebaseapp.com/">here</a>.

The actual datepicker dropdowns are from the <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/datepicker">Angular Material</a> library.
